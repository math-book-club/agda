# Agda

Exploring formally verified software development.


## Resources

We use the following resources:
* [Programming Language Foundations in Agda](plfa.github.io)
* [Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics](https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/)

## Dev Environment

An agda development environment can be quickly set up with docker using the `env-agda` script.

## Repo Structure

Create a new folder in the `sandbox` directory to do exercises or explore design patterns. Use the
`project` folder for any larger-scale ideas. If a project becomes large enough, we can eventually transfer
it into its own repo.

## Repo Practices

Use Pull Requests when possible to showcase changes. We're not looking to gate what gets merged into
master, its more that PR's serve as a great discussion forum for new syntax/changes.

Avoid history-changing git actions.
